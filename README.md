# concepts

Bite sized programming presentations

## overview

DRY, version controlled, collaboratively built courseware. The overall goal is to divide EDA's lecture material into discrete, elemental concepts. There will be a 3-8 min screencast for each of these concepts, either ours or found on the internet, which provides a clear, concise description of the concept. 

Currently, for both streams, each concept has its own folder and is organized by week and day. These folders will have all the necessary materials to create + edit these screencasts. The contents are as follows:

1. a [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) html file to create slides 
2. a README containing a written summary of the concept, and a link to the video
3. an info.jsonId file containing a jsonId definition of the concept
4. a template_code file, containing any necessary code demos for the screencast
5. any other media (images, etc.)
