# concepts

Bite sized programming presentations

## overview

DRY, version controlled, collaboratively built courseware. The overall goal is to divide EDA's lecture material into discrete, elemental concepts. There will be a 3-8 min screencast for each of these concepts, either ours or found on the internet, which provides a clear, concise description of the concept. 

Each concept has its own folder and is organized by ?. These folders will have all the necessary materials to create + edit these screencasts. The contents are as follows:

1. a [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) html file to create slides 
2. a README containing a written summary of the concept, and a link to the video
3. an info.jsonId file containing a [jsonId definition of the concept] (https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/types)
4. a template_code file, containing any necessary code demos for the screencast
5. any other media (images, etc.)

## organization of concepts
